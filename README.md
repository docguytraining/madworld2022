## So what do you expect me to do with this stuff?

If you are familiar with GitHub, feel free to clone the repo into a GIT repo on your own machine. There are lots of tuturoials out there on how to do that. 

However, if you don't want to go to the hastle of cloining the repo, the easiest thing to do is to download a zipped folder with all these files. 

1. Click the green **Code** button at the top of this page. 
1. Click **Download ZIP**.
1. Open the download folder and right-click on the zip package. 
1. Click Extract. 

That will give you the latest version of all my project files.
