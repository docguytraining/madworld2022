## Session description
MadCap Flare is an amazing solution that lets you do a lot of cool things. Sometimes you need to make unique scripted customizations for your particular project that aren't supported out of the box. jQuery to the rescue! In this workshop, longtime MadWorld presenter Paul Pehson will walk you through several jQuery scripts that he uses in some of his Flare projects. First we'll talk about some scripting basics, then we'll talk about the best way to add scripts to your project. Paul will then share with you the code for several jQuery enhancements he uses, including sticky table headers, table sorting, scripted feedback links, show/hide divs based on role, adding text before a thumbnail image, and changing the top menu size when scrolling. Sample scripts will be provided to all attendees as well as a working Flare project that contains the sripts so you can see thm in action.

## Other information

There are two Flare projects. The first is the one you want if you are attending the class in-person (or watching remotely) and you want to work alongside, and make the changes yourself. 

The second, (name), is a completed version of the project with all the scripts running as described above. Use this one if you are not watching the presentation, or if you just want to see the completed scripts in a working project. (This can be helpful for troubleshooting if your scripts aren't working like you expect.)
