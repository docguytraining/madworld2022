# Working with Confluence: From import to publishing multiple targets

## Powerpoint slides

The PowerPoint slides for this session are available publicly on [Google Drive.](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/10fBrY3c_aJwM-29mHtu6Ubne1s6dxlA_/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=105054228189904904617&rtpof=true&sd=true) 

## Session description
MadCap Flare's free integration with Atlassian Confluence gives you a lot of flexibility in working with others to develop new content. In this session, we'll cover some Confluence use cases, we'll walk through setting up a Confluence integration, and importing content into Flare. We'll talk about more advanced use cases such as applying styles, using conditions, targeting different output types, modifying table headers (for accessibility) and more.

## Other information

The sample project uses a connection to Atlassian Confluence Cloud. For this example, I've created a free account on Confluence to demonstrate what you can do. Confluence credentials are not stored in the project, so if you try to just directly import this Confluence file yourself, you will get an error. This one will be harder to just look at the resulting project to see how things work, so be aware of that limitation. (You'll probably want to watch the session video if you aren't attending live or in-person.)
